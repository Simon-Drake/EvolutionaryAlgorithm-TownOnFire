# TownOnFire
**Bio-Inspired Computing**

Simulation of fire spread. 



To run: 

- Go to parent directory. 
- Run *python3 main.py*  - this will open CAPYLE. 
- Open TownOnFire.py
- Click "Apply Configuration and run CA" and "Play". 


**Licence note** : I only developed the file "TownOnFire.py" i.e. the evolutionary algorithm. The UI was created by Peter Worsley.
